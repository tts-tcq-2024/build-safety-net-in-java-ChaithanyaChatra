- Expected Output: "S530"
  - Explanation: 
    - 'S' maps to 'S'
    - 'M' maps to '5'
    - 'I' is a vowel, so it's ignored.
    - 'T' maps to '3'

  - Final result: "S530"

Test Case 2: Valid Name with Repeated Consonants
- Input: "Parker"
- Expected Output: "P620"
  - Explanation: 
    - 'P' maps to 'P'
    - 'A' is a vowel, so it's ignored.
    - 'R' maps to '6'
    - 'K' maps to '2'
    - 'E' is a vowel, so it's ignored.
    - 'R' is repeated but ignored due to no change in code.
  - Final result: "P620"

Test Case 3: Single Character Name
- Input: "A"
- Expected Output: "A000"
  - Explanation: Single letter names should be padded with three zeros.
  - Final result: "A000"

Test Case 4: Empty String
- Input: ""
- Expected Output: ""
  - Explanation: Empty input should return an empty string.
  - Final result: ""

Test Case 5: Null Input
- Input: null
- Expected Output: ""
  - Explanation: Null input should return an empty string.
  - Final result: ""

Test Case 6: Name with Special Characters (spaces, digits, etc.)

  - Explanation:
    - 'W' is ignored because it’s not preceded by a vowel.
    - 'H' is ignored because it follows a consonant.
    - 'I' is a vowel and ignored.

- Expected Output: "A640"
  - Explanation:
    - 'A' maps to 'A'
    - 'U' is a vowel and ignored.
    - 'R' maps to '6'
    - 'E' is a vowel and ignored.
    - 'L' maps to '4'
    - 'I' is a vowel and ignored.
    - 'A' is a vowel and ignored.
  - Final result: "A640"

Test Case 9: Name shorter than 4 Characters
- Input: "Al"
- Expected Output: "A400"
  - Explanation:
    - 'A' maps to 'A'
    - 'L' maps to '4'
    - The name is too short, so it’s padded with a zero.
  - Final result: "A400"

Test Case 10: Case Insensitivity
- Input: "barker"
- Expected Output: "B620"
  - Explanation: The method should be case-insensitive.
  - Final result: "B620"

Test Case 11: Name with Multiple Similar Characters
- Input: "Ssssss"
- Expected Output: "S230"
  - Explanation:
    - 'S' maps to 'S'
    - The repeated 'S' is ignored since it maps to the same code '2'.
    - The final result should be "S230", since the code '2' is appended after the first 'S'.
  - Final result: "S230"

Test Case 12: Name with Numbers and Special Characters
